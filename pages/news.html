            Have you ever been asked a question that seemed a little ridiculous
            but ended up being a great conversation starter? That's exactly what
            happened to the author during a camp session on the fourth or fifth
            day.The coach was chatting with a girl and to keep the conversation
            going, asked her, "Can you prove that you are a girl?" At first, she
            laughed and was a bit taken aback, but she soon came up with an
            answer that was both creative and impressive.
